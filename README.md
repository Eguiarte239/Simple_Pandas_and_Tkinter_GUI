## Simple GUI to retrieve data from CSV using pandas and Tkinter
As its name says, this is a pretty simple GUI created with Tkinter with which you'll be able to retrieve data from a CSV file and display it in a list box.
You can filter by age and occupation. If you decide to filter it by age then you'll be able to add another filter, selecting one out of three age ranges to display.
In addition to this, you'll now be able to get the amount of records with the same occupation
or age, depending on your filter.
